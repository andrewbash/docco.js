docco.js
========

A clean version of [Docco](http://ashkenas.com/docco/)

Docco uses an interesting format of markdown + source code.
It is great to document short examples and small applications.

However, the implementation is old and rather hackish.
This intends to be a more flexible, cleaner implementation of the same format.
